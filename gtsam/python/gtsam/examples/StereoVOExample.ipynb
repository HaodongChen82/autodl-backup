        "1.  A robot starts at the origin (Pose 1: `X(1)`).\n",
        "2.  The robot moves approximately one meter forward (Pose 2: `X(2)`).\n",

        "We will:\n",
        "- Define camera calibration and noise models.\n",
        "- Create a factor graph representing the problem.\n",
        "- Provide initial estimates for poses and landmark positions.\n",
        "- Optimize the graph using Levenberg-Marquardt to find the most probable configuration.\n",
