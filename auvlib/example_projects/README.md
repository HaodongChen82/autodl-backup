Example projects
================

This folder contains example projects showing how to build
new c++ projects outside of the main project that depend
on the libraries that are defined in it.

There are two projects, one simpler one that highlights
[how to read different kinds of data](https://github.com/nilsbore/auvlib/tree/master/example_projects/data_project),
and one that
[contains complex examples](https://github.com/nilsbore/auvlib/tree/master/example_projects/complete_project)
running SLAM and draping bathymetry with sss imagery.
