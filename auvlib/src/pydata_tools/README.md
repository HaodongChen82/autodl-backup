# pydata_tools

This library contains the following modules: `std_data`, `gsf_data`, `xtf_data`, `all_data` and `csv_data`.
They contain data structures corresponding to types of those file formats, and functions for reading them from data.
A basic usage is demonstrated in
[this file](https://github.com/nilsbore/auvlib/blob/master/src/pydata_tools/examples/parse_or_load_gsf.py),
but the other libraries have all of the corresponding methods defined for those data types.

For the complete documentation, see [the documentation page](https://nilsbore.github.io/auvlib-docs/data_tools.html).
